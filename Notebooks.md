# Notebooks

This section of the **ExpCGM** website presents notebooks contributed by the framework's user community. They illustrate how the framework can be used and provide Python code that others can download and modify. Please remember to acknowledge the authors of these notebooks in any research publications that build upon their work.

## MSU Undergraduate Notebooks

These notebooks illustrating the Essential elements of the framework were developed by MSU students Doruk Yaldiz and Jazzmin Partridge:

* [MSU Essentials](/ExpCGM/notebooks/MSUEssentials) shows how to use Python to reproduce the plot on the [Essentials](/ExpCGM/descriptions/Essentials) page illustrating the relationship between atmospheric radius and atmospheric specific energy in **ExpCGM**.

* [MSU Generalizable](/ExpCGM/notebooks/MSUGeneralizable) shows how to extend the Python code in the [MSU Essentials](/ExpCGM/notebooks/MSUEssentials) notebook, so that user-defined pressure profiles and potential wells can be incorporated into **ExpCGM**.

The notebooks currently in this section of the website are prototypes that are in the process of being corrected and refined.
