# Notebooks

This section of the **ExpCGM** website presents notebooks contributed by the framework's user community. They illustrate how the framework can be used and provide Python code that others can download and modify. Please remember to acknowledge the authors of these notebooks in any research publications that build upon their work.

{: .warning}
The notebooks currently in this section of the website are prototypes that may still be further corrected and refined.

## MSU Undergraduate Notebooks

These notebooks illustrating the Essential elements of the framework were developed by MSU students Doruk Yaldiz and Jazzmin Partridge:
