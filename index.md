# Introduction

How does a gaseous galactic halo respond to energy input from the central galaxy?

Some of the energy coming from a galaxy may enter the halo in thermal form. Another portion of it may enter in kinetic form, which later dissipates into thermal energy. Both kinds of energy injection produce a similar response: They cause the atmosphere to expand, converting excess kinetic or thermal energy into gravitational potential energy. Expansion then reduces both the atmosphere's pressure and density, and therefore also the rate at which radiative cooling allows gas to sink into the galaxy.

Those features of atmospheric expansion are what motivated development of ExpCGM, a simple modeling framework for a galaxy's circumgalactic medium (CGM) that explicitly accounts for atmospheric expansion as feedback energy into converts into gravitational potential energy.

This website defines the ExpCGM framework. Newcomers should begin with the [Essentials](Essentials) document.
